# Open Source Mechanical Keyboard

## The design and planning of a custom mechanical keyboard built from the ground up; everything is (mostly) going to be designed from scratch (some parts just not worth designing because they already exist on the market). I also plan to make this as cheap and affordable as possible, so people can just get all of the parts themselves and then assemble it.

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

- I'm going to design and eventually create a nice and clean mechanical keyboard, and document the process along the way. I also plan to add extra features, such as a volume knob and a small screen that displays anything you want it to. I'm excited to do something hands-on, I've seen enough Youtube videos on keyboards to make me want to do something similar.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

- A lot of time needs to be allocated in designing in planning, especially since I plan to add more than just a keyboard PCB.
- I'll have to learn how to 3D model in order to plan the parts of the keyboard and make them fit, as well as do more research on the PCB designing industry.
  - For the PCB I'll have to investigate what popular PCB makers there are, and do research on how they differ.
  - For keycaps, if I can design and manufacture custom acrylic keycaps that would be amazing, but if not I'll stick with finding a reputable company.
  - For switches I'll have to (once again) do more research, though I already have a little bit of prior knowledge on switches.
  - I'm considering not even making a case (or a minimal one at that). I might just make a acrylic backplate for PCB standoffs to rest on, and some more acrylic to diffuse the LEDs.

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.

| Product         | Supplier/Link                         | Cost   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
|                 |                                       | $      |
|                 |                                       | $      |
| Total           |                                       | $      |
